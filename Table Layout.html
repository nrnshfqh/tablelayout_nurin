		is to complete my exercises given by my lecturer. It is hard to learn this subject by myself since i do not have so much basic and it kind of bothering and annoying when things 
		does not turns out as what they should be. It is not easy from learning all about libraries and now doing coding while the person do not have any basic to do the website. Videos
		on youtube does not really help.</p>
	
		<p style="text-align:justify;margin:1px;padding:15px;">Hence,lecturer that teach me this subject really helps me in finding the right coding and avoid from using css because my
		lecturer wants us to learn slowly and he also teach and tell us which coding is wrong. Education are infinity. As a students, we need to always alert with the knowledge given. This
		is to see whether we apply it on our daily life or work life or not.</p>
